# MemoryGame in JS

This is a memory game. First of all I would like to point out, this is not my own code. This is code made by Adam Khoury on Youtube. But, that does not change whether I learned anythig from his video or not. I learned a lot watching and listening to him explain the code. I plan on working with his code, and maybe make my own. The styling is my own though, and the tile picture of choice.

Have fun!
